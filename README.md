### Hi, I'm Soham GuptaðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on launching FORM, an AI-powered basketball application that helps players improve their jumpshot by using computer vision. I built the app in Swift and used the CoreML framework to build an action classification model. I am also part of a research team at UIUC.
- ðŸŒ± Along with, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, Iâ€™m currently learning graph theory and algorithms in Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on hackathons!!! I love to spend weekends working on coding projects, feel free to contact me!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with digital music production, specifically I'm looking to familiarize myself with FLStudio.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about AI, Web Development, App Development, Hackathons, High School, Graph Algorithms, and Research Projects

- âš¡ Fun fact: I once superglued my eye shut. Turns out that hot water solved the problem (after a bit of panic :))

Most of my current projects aren't using Github to manage the codebase, but I am still very active! Feel free to reach out so we can chat and collaborate!
